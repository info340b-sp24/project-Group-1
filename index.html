        Our project is an e-commerce page for UW Students to sell and buy products from other students. 
        The goal of the project is to ensure secure access through student login (netID) as well as
        provide students with a simple design that meets unique student needs when selling or buying items.

        As technology advances, students rely on spaces such as OfferUp in order to quickly sell or buy items
        they need. However, with spaces like these, it is difficult to find a target audience of just UW students
        and marketplaces like OfferUp don't provide enough local options and can pose consumer security risks.
        Furthermore, college students have a unique buying/selling attitude. For instance, students are often moving
        creating the constant need to buy or sell furniture. Likewise, classes often lead to varying needs in school
        supplies as well as the issue of potential financial difficulties as textbooks are expensive and usually
        one-time use, and therefore easier to buy second-hand.

        Currently, the platforms that students go to are OfferUp, UW Surplus Store and social media. However,
        UW Surplus Store supplies the market of student necessities but doesn’t deliver enough options and
        availability. Likewise, because student’s social media platforms often only consist of other students,
        students often rely on posting their stories on Instagram or Snapchat to sell or buy items. The issue with
        this however is the lack of trust and security of ensuring that money is being sent, or the item is being delivered.

        Often when looking to sell or buy items, there is a target location and audience, and many times,
        it can be difficult to find items based on zip code. It can also be a hassle to list items and ship them,
        especially if the items are furniture items or large bulky items. More specifically, students often struggle 
        to find people to pick up unneeded school supplies or furniture just by networking in the general location. 
        Another detractor in many student lives is the struggle to pay for new furniture or school supplies each academic
        quarter, or even find secondhand equipment for cheap. A web app can help with these issues by creating a space that
        safely allows students to quickly list and sell unwanted items as well as buy second hand items for discounted prices.
