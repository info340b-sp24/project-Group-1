                    <p>
                        Our project is an e-commerce page for UW Students to sell and buy products from other
                        students. The goal of the project is to provide students with a simple design that meets
                        unique student needs when selling or buying items.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students currently rely on spaces such as <a href="https://offerup.com/">OfferUp</a> to quickly sell
                        or buy items they need. However, with spaces like these, it is difficult to find a target
                        audience of just UW students and marketplaces like OfferUp don't provide enough local
                        options and can pose consumer security risks. Furthermore, college students have a
                        unique buying/selling attitude. For instance, students are often moving creating the
                        constant need to buy or sell furniture. Likewise, classes often lead to varying needs in
                        school supplies as well as the issue of potential financial difficulties as textbooks
                        are expensive and usually one-time use, and therefore easier to buy second-hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, the platforms that students go to are OfferUp, UW Surplus Store and social media.
                        Offerup has a marketplace which is indiscriminate in regards to demographic, but this does
                        not consider the unique nature of cheap and quick quick turnaround student supply and demand,
                        which if isolated, can cancel out. UW Surplus Store supplies the market of student necessities
                        but doesn’t deliver enough options and availability. Likewise, because student’s social media
                        platforms often only consist of other students, students often rely on posting their stories
                        on <a href="instagram.com">Instagram</a> or <a href="snapchat.com">Snapchat</a> to sell or buy items. The issue with this however is the lack of trust
                        and security of ensuring that money is being sent, or the item is being delivered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often when looking to sell or buy items, there is a target location and audience, and many times,
                        it can be difficult to find items based on zip code. It can also be a hassle to list items and ship them,
                        especially if the items are furniture items or large bulky items. More specifically, students often struggle
                        to find people to pick up unneeded school supplies or furniture just by networking in the general location.
                        Another detractor in many student lives is the struggle to pay for new furniture or school supplies each academic
                        quarter, or even find secondhand equipment for cheap. A web app can help with these issues by creating a space that
                        safely allows students to quickly list and sell unwanted items as well as buy second hand items for discounted prices.

                <h2>App Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        The users of the proposed application will be UW students living near campus that have
                        something that they need to buy or sell. The app targets all UW students regardless of
                        demographic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expected features include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Account Creation & Sign In</em> - Students can create a username and password associated with a UW NetID to sign in with</li>
                        <li><em>Posting & Editing Listings</em> - Users can post listings of items associated with a price and title, and edit those listings</li>
                        <li><em>Purchasing</em> - Users can select to purchase listings and confirm purchases, adding to their purchase history</li>
                        <li><em>Posting Seller Reviews</em> - Users can post reviews of other users if they have purchased from them</li>
                        <li><em>Searching & Filtering</em> - Users can search active listings and filter by price range, seller rating, category and age of listing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Users will view information for various listings, seller reviews, and purchase history. This
                        information will be stored in our application database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using this application will solve the problem of student needs not being met by isolating the local market
                        so that matching seller and buyer attitudes (desiring quick, cheap, and easy exchanges) meet each others' expectations.
                        A platform like this would eliminate waste of goods that have a longer shelf life than the time they are used by their initial purchaser,
                        and frustration at the time it takes to find (for example) someone selling or buying the same textbook or piece of furniture one is looking for.
